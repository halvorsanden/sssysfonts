# sssysfonts

[Style Stage](https://github.com/5t3ph/stylestage) contribution to showcase the use of system fonts

### Goals

- Advocate system fonts.
- Demonstrate typography in a text-heavy document.
- Use no media queries.
- Contribute to a cool project that showcases different CSS techniques and serves as a learning resource.
- Learn something new.
- Try to make links stand out without styling them as buttons.

### System fonts have become my go-to for most projects because:

- They are made for the users’ systems.
- Everyone has them, the fonts are present as soon as the CSS is loaded.
- I save time by not having to look for fonts that are marginally different from each other anyway.
- I spend the time working on typography instead of font selection. It’s more fun and more valuable.
- It avoids the potentially unexpected break in user experience that can happen when applications use branding fonts.
- Fonts that draw attention to themselves, draw attention away from the content or interface.
- Fonts and typography can not rise above a neutral effect on a brand.
- It’s exciting not knowing exactly how it will look on your screen.

### Fallbacks

There is only fallback for font-sizes set using [clamp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp), which was new in 2020.
