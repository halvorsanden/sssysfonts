# sssysfonts

[Stylestage](https://github.com/5t3ph/stylestage) contribution to showcase the use of system fonts

### Goals

- Advocate system fonts.
- Demonstrate typography in a text-heavy document.
- Use no media queries.
- Contribute to a cool project that showcases different CSS techniques and serves as a learning resource.
- Learn something new.
- Try to make links stand out without styling them as buttons.

### System fonts have become my go-to for most projects because:

- They are made for the users’ systems.
- Everyone has them, the fonts are present as soon as the CSS is loaded.
- I save time by not having to look for fonts that are marginally different from each other anyway.
- I spend the time working on typography instead of font selection. It’s more fun and more valuable.
- It avoids the potentially unexpected break in user experience that can happen when applications use branding fonts.
- Fonts that draw attention to themselves, draw attention away from the content or interface.
- Fonts and typography can not rise above a neutral effect on a brand.
- It’s exciting not knowing exactly how it will look on your screen.

### Fallbacks

There is only fallback for font-sizes set using [clamp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp), which was new in 2020.

### Code quality

The [Stylestage](https://github.com/5t3ph/stylestage) project shows the strength and flexibility of CSS. It also demonstrates that HTML and CSS are not structure and style separated – they are intertwined. It’s impossible to build a universal HTML structure that you can do anything with CSS-wise.

While recognising that this is a fun and effective way to learn and share, I would have liked some more classes to avoid a few ugly CSS selectors. There are also a couple of minor structural changes that I think could have led to even better semantics and typography.

One can argue that the CSS is not at the level it could have been because of zero control over the HTML, but that would have contradicted the whole point of the project.
