Stylestage contribution to showcase the use of system fonts

System fonts have become my go-to for most projects because:
- They are made for the users’ systems.
- Everyone have them.
- I save time by not having to look for fonts that are marginally different from each other anyway.
- I spend the time working on typography instead of font selection. It’s more fun and more valuable.
- It avoids the potentially unexpected break that can happen when applications use custom fonts.
- 99.9 per cent of font usage has no impact on brand as long as it’s not making things difficult to read.
- Fonts that draw attention to themselves, draw attention away from the content or interface.
- It’s exciting not knowing exactly how it will look on your screen.
